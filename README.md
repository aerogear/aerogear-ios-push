## Features

* Register (Programmatically and plist) on [AeroGear UnifiedPush Server](https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-unifiedpush-server/)
* Send metrics to [AeroGear UnifiedPush Server](https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-unifiedpush-server/)

## Installation

### CocoaPods

In your `Podfile` add:

```bash
pod 'AeroGear-Push-Swift'
```

and then:

```bash
pod install
```

to install your dependencies

## Usage

### Push registration (Programmatically)

```swift
// setup registration
let registration = DeviceRegistration(serverURL: URL(string: "<#AeroGear UnifiedPush Server URL#>")!)

// attempt to register
registration.register(
        clientInfo: { (clientDevice: ClientDeviceInformation!) in
            // setup configuration
            clientDevice.deviceToken = deviceToken
            clientDevice.variantID = "<# Variant Id #>"
            clientDevice.variantSecret = "<# Variant Secret #>"

            // apply the token, to identify THIS device
            let currentDevice = UIDevice()

            // -- optional config --
            // set some 'useful' hardware information params
            clientDevice.operatingSystem = currentDevice.systemName
            clientDevice.osVersion = currentDevice.systemVersion
            clientDevice.deviceType = currentDevice.model
        },
        success: {
            print("UnifiedPush Server registration succeeded")
        },
        failure: { (error: Error!) in
            print("failed to register, error: \(error.localizedDescription)")
        }
)
```

### Push registration (plist)

```swift
// setup registration
let registration = DeviceRegistration(config: "pushconfig")

// attempt to register
registration.register(
        clientInfo: { (clientDevice: ClientDeviceInformation!) in
            // setup configuration
            clientDevice.deviceToken = deviceToken

            // apply the token, to identify THIS device
            let currentDevice = UIDevice()
            
            // set some 'useful' hardware information params
            clientDevice.operatingSystem = currentDevice.systemName
            clientDevice.osVersion = currentDevice.systemVersion
            clientDevice.deviceType = currentDevice.model
        },
        success: {
            print("UnifiedPush Server registration succeeded")
        },
        failure: { (error: Error!) in
            print("failed to register, error: \(error.localizedDescription)")
        }
)
```

In your application, create a `pushconfig.plist` file, and add the following properties:

```xml
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
  <key>serverURL</key>
  <string><# URL of the running AeroGear UnifiedPush Server #></string>
  <key>variantID</key>
  <string><# Variant Id #></string>
  <key>variantSecret</key>
  <string><# Variant Secret #></string>
</dict>
</plist>
```

> NOTE: If your UPS server installation uses a `self-signed certificate`, you can find a quick solution on how to enable support on our [troubleshooting page](https://aerogear.org/docs/unifiedpush/aerogear-push-ios/troubleshooting/#_question_failure_to_connect_when_server_uses_a_self_signed_certificate), as well as links for further information on how to properly enable it on your iOS production applications.

### Push analytics

If you are interested in monitoring how a push message relates to the usage of your app, you can use metrics. Those metrics are displayed in the AeroGear UnifiedPush Server's console.

#### Metrics when app is launched

```swift
func application(_ application: UIApplication, 
                 didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {

    // Send metrics when app is launched due to push notification
    PushAnalytics.sendMetricsWhenAppLaunched(launchOptions: launchOptions)
    
    return true
}
```

#### Metrics when the app is brought from background to foreground

```swift
func application(_ application: UIApplication,
                 didReceiveRemoteNotification userInfo: [AnyHashable: Any],
                 fetchCompletionHandler: @escaping (UIBackgroundFetchResult) -> Void) {

    // Send metrics when app is launched due to push notification
    PushAnalytics.sendMetricsWhenAppAwoken(applicationState: application.applicationState, userInfo: userInfo)

    // ... Some stuffs ...

    // No additional data to fetch
    fetchCompletionHandler(UIBackgroundFetchResult.noData)
    
}
```
