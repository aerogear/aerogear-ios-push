# aerogear-ios-push [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/aerogear/aerogear-ios-push.png)](https://travis-ci.org/aerogear/aerogear-ios-push)

> This module currently build with Xcode 9 and supports iOS9, iOS10, iOS11.
> There is an [ObjC version in 1.x_dev branch](https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-ios-push/tree/1.x_dev).

**iOS Push Notification Registration SDK for the AeroGear UnifiedPush Server**

A small and handy library written in [Swift 4.0](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) that helps to register iOS applications with the [AeroGear UnifiedPush Server](https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-unified-push-server).

### Build, test and play with aerogear-ios-push

1. Clone this project

2. Get the dependencies

The project uses [OHHTTPStubs](https://github.com/AliSoftware/OHHTTPStubs) framework for stubbing its http network requests and utilizes [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) for handling its dependencies. As a pre-requisite, install [CocoaPods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html) and then install the pod. On the root directory of the project run:
```bash
pod install
```
3. open AeroGearPush.xcworkspace

## Adding the library to your project
To add the library in your project, you can either use [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) or manual install either by dragging the code or building a ```framework``` to install in your project. See the respective sections below for instructions:

In your ```Podfile``` add:

```
pod 'AeroGear-Push-Swift'
```

and then:

```bash
pod install
```

to install your dependencies.

Finally, inside Xcode, go to the Capabilities section for your target and switch Push Notifications on.

## Example Usage

### Push registration

```swift
  func application(_ application: UIApplication, didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken deviceToken: Data) {
     // setup registration
    let registration = DeviceRegistration(serverURL: URL(string: "<# URL of the running AeroGear UnifiedPush Server #>")!)

    // attemp to register
    registration.register(clientInfo: { (clientDevice: ClientDeviceInformation!) in
        // setup configuration
        clientDevice.deviceToken = deviceToken
        clientDevice.variantID = "<# Variant Id #>"
        clientDevice.variantSecret = "<# Variant Secret #>"

        // apply the token, to identify THIS device
        let currentDevice = UIDevice()

        // --optional config--
        // set some 'useful' hardware information params
        clientDevice.operatingSystem = currentDevice.systemName
        clientDevice.osVersion = currentDevice.systemVersion
        clientDevice.deviceType = currentDevice.model
        },

        success: {
            print("UnifiedPush Server registration succeeded")
        },
        failure: {(error: Error!) in
            print("failed to register, error: \(error.localizedDescription)")
        })
}
```

### Push registration using plist config file

In the ```AppDelegate.swift``` file:
```swift
  func application(_ application: UIApplication, didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken deviceToken: Data) {
     // setup registration
    let registration = DeviceRegistration(config: "pushconfig")

    // attemp to register
    registration.register(clientInfo: { (clientDevice: ClientDeviceInformation!) in
        // setup configuration
        clientDevice.deviceToken = deviceToken
        let currentDevice = UIDevice()
        // set some 'useful' hardware information params
        clientDevice.operatingSystem = currentDevice.systemName
        clientDevice.osVersion = currentDevice.systemVersion
        clientDevice.deviceType = currentDevice.model
        },       
        success: {
            print("UnifiedPush Server registration succeeded")
        },
        failure: {(error: Error!) in
            print("failed to register, error: \(error.localizedDescription)")
        })
}
```

In your application, create a new ```pushconfig.plist``` file, and add the following properties:
```xml
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
  <key>serverURL</key>
  <string><# URL of the running AeroGear UnifiedPush Server #></string>
  <key>variantID</key>
  <string><# Variant Id #></string>
  <key>variantSecret</key>
  <string><# Variant Secret #></string>
</dict>
</plist>
```

> NOTE: If your UPS server installation uses a ```self-signed certificate```, you can find a quick solution on how to enable support on our [troubleshooting page](https://aerogear.org/docs/unifiedpush/aerogear-push-ios/troubleshooting/#_question_failure_to_connect_when_server_uses_a_self_signed_certificate), as well as links for further information on how to properly enable it on your iOS production applications.

### Push analytics

If you are interested in monitoring how a push message relates to the usage of your app, you can use metrics. Those metrics are displayed in the AeroGear UnifiedPush Server's console.

* Send metrics when app is launched due to push notification
```swift
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
        PushAnalytics.sendMetricsWhenAppLaunched(launchOptions: launchOptions)
        return true
    }
```
* Send metrics when the app is brought from background to foreground due to a push notification
```swift
    func application(_ application: UIApplication, didReceiveRemoteNotification userInfo: [AnyHashable: Any], fetchCompletionHandler: @escaping (UIBackgroundFetchResult) -> Void) {
        // Send metrics when app is launched due to push notification
        PushAnalytics.sendMetricsWhenAppAwoken(applicationState: application.applicationState, userInfo: userInfo)

        // Do stuff ...
        fetchCompletionHandler(UIBackgroundFetchResult.noData)
    }
```
