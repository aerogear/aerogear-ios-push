### Build, test and play with aerogear-ios-push

1. Clone this project

2. Get the dependencies

The project uses [OHHTTPStubs](https://github.com/AliSoftware/OHHTTPStubs) framework for stubbing its http network requests and utilizes [cocoapods](http://cocoapods.org) 0.36 release for handling its dependencies. As a pre-requisite, install [cocoapods](http://blog.cocoapods.org/CocoaPods-0.36/) and then install the pod. On the root directory of the project run:
```bash
pod install
```
3. open AeroGearPushSwift.xcworkspace

## Adding the library to your project 
To add the library in your project, you can either use [Cocoapods](http://cocoapods.org) or manual install either by dragging the code or building a ```framework``` to install in your project. See the respective sections below for instructions:

### Using [Cocoapods](http://cocoapods.org)
Support for Swift frameworks is supported from [CocoaPods-0.36 release](http://blog.cocoapods.org/CocoaPods-0.36/) upwards. In your ```Podfile``` add:

```
pod 'AeroGear-Push-Swift'
```

and then:

```bash
pod install
```

to install your dependencies

### Manual Installation

#### Drag-and-Drop the project
Follow these steps to add the library in your Swift project:

1. Add AeroGearPush as a [submodule](http://git-scm.com/docs/git-submodule) in your project. Open a terminal and navigate to your project directory. Then enter:
```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-ios-push.git
```
2. Open the `aerogear-ios-push` folder, and drag the `AeroGearPush.xcodeproj` into the file navigator in Xcode.
3. In Xcode select your application target  and under the "Targets" heading section, ensure that the 'iOS  Deployment Target'  matches the application target of AeroGearPush.framework (Currently set to 8.0).
5. Select the  "Build Phases"  heading section,  expand the "Target Dependencies" group and add  `AeroGearPush.framework`.
7. Click on the `+` button at the top left of the panel and select "New Copy Files Phase". Rename this new phase to "Copy Frameworks", set the "Destination" to "Frameworks", and add `AeroGearPush.framework`.


#### Using a ```.framework``` build

To build the library simply run the build script:

    build.sh

The build script will generate a ```build``` folder in the current directory, containing an universal framework library that you can drag-and-drop in your project. The framework build resides in:

    build/Release-universal/AeroGearPush.framework

Now, on your application targets’ “General” settings tab and in the “Linked Frameworks and Libraries” section, drag-and-drop the framework build.  Then click the 'Build Phases' tab, click the '+' symbol, select "New Copy Files Phase", expand the section, select 'Frameworks' from the Destination combo box.  Click the '+' symbol and select the 'AeroGearPush.framework'

You are now ready to use the library in your project.

## Example Usage

### Push registration

```swift
  func application(application: UIApplication!, didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken deviceToken: NSData!) {
     // setup registration
    let registration = AGDeviceRegistration(serverURL: NSURL(string: "<# URL of the running AeroGear UnifiedPush Server #>")!)
    
    // attemp to register
    registration.registerWithClientInfo({ (clientInfo: AGClientDeviceInformation!) in
        // setup configuration
        clientInfo.deviceToken = deviceToken
        clientInfo.variantID = "<# Variant Id #>"
        clientInfo.variantSecret = "<# Variant Secret #>"
        
        // apply the token, to identify THIS device
        let currentDevice = UIDevice()
        
        // --optional config--
        // set some 'useful' hardware information params
        clientInfo.operatingSystem = currentDevice.systemName
        clientInfo.osVersion = currentDevice.systemVersion
        clientInfo.deviceType = currentDevice.model
        },
        
        success: {
            println("UnifiedPush Server registration succeeded")
        },
        failure: {(error: NSError!) in
            println("failed to register, error: \(error.description)")
        })
}
```

### Push registration using plist config file

In the ```AppDelegate.swift``` file:
```swift
  func application(application: UIApplication!, didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken deviceToken: NSData!) {
     // setup registration
    let registration = AGDeviceRegistration()
    
    // attemp to register
    registration.registerWithClientInfo({ (clientInfo: AGClientDeviceInformation!) in
        // setup configuration
        clientInfo.deviceToken = deviceToken
        let currentDevice = UIDevice()
        // set some 'useful' hardware information params
        clientInfo.operatingSystem = currentDevice.systemName
        clientInfo.osVersion = currentDevice.systemVersion
        clientInfo.deviceType = currentDevice.model
        },       
        success: {
            println("UnifiedPush Server registration succeeded")
        },
        failure: {(error: NSError!) in
            println("failed to register, error: \(error.description)")
        })
}
```

In your application ```info.plist```, add the following properties:
```xml
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
  <key>serverURL</key>
  <string><# URL of the running AeroGear UnifiedPush Server #></string>
  <key>variantID</key>
  <string><# Variant Id #></string>
  <key>variantSecret</key>
  <string><# Variant Secret #></string>
</dict>
</plist>
```

> NOTE: If your UPS server installation uses a ```self-signed certificate```, you can find a quick solution on how to enable support on our [troubleshooting page](https://aerogear.org/docs/unifiedpush/aerogear-push-ios/troubleshooting/#_question_failure_to_connect_when_server_uses_a_self_signed_certificate), as well as links for further information on how to properly enable it on your iOS production applications.

### Push analytics

If you are interested in monitoring how a push message relates to the usage of your app, you can use metrics. Those emtrics are displayed in the AeroGear UnifiedPush Server's console.

* Send metrics when app is launched due to push notification
```swift
func application(application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [NSObject: AnyObject]?) -> Bool {
        AGPushAnalytics.sendMetricsWhenAppLaunched(launchOptions)
        return true
    }
```
* Send metrics when the app is brought from background to foreground due to a push notification
```swift
    func application(application: UIApplication, didReceiveRemoteNotification userInfo: [NSObject: AnyObject], fetchCompletionHandler: (UIBackgroundFetchResult) -> Void) {      
        // Send metrics when app is launched due to push notification
        AGPushAnalytics.sendMetricsWhenAppAwoken(application.applicationState, userInfo: userInfo)
        
        // Do stuff ...
        fetchCompletionHandler(UIBackgroundFetchResult.NoData)
    }
```
